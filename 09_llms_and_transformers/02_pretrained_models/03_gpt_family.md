# GPT Family Models üöÄ

GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models revolutionized text generation by showing that simple next-word prediction, when scaled massively, leads to incredible emergent capabilities. Think of GPT as a master storyteller who has read everything and can continue any story with remarkable coherence and creativity.

## üéØ What Makes GPT Special

### The Autoregressive Approach

**Core Principle:** Predict the next word given all previous words

**Training Objective:**
```
Given: "The cat sat on the"
Predict: "mat" (or any plausible next word)
```

**Why this works:**
- Learns natural language patterns
- Develops understanding through generation
- Scales beautifully with data and compute
- Enables diverse creative applications

### Decoder-Only Architecture

**GPT Structure:**
- **Decoder-only** transformer (no encoder)
- **Causal attention** (can't see future tokens)
- **Autoregressive generation** (one token at a time)
- **Large scale** (billions to trillions of parameters)

**Key Innovation:** Masked self-attention prevents looking ahead

```
Token:     The    cat    sat    on     the
Attention: ‚úì      ‚úì‚úì     ‚úì‚úì‚úì    ‚úì‚úì‚úì‚úì   ‚úì‚úì‚úì‚úì‚úì
```

## üß† How GPT Models Work

### Training Process

**Stage 1: Pre-training**
```
Massive text corpus ‚Üí Next token prediction ‚Üí General language model
```

**Stage 2: Instruction Tuning (Modern GPTs)**
```
Instruction-response pairs ‚Üí Fine-tuning ‚Üí Instruction-following model
```

**Stage 3: RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)**
```
Human preferences ‚Üí Reward model ‚Üí Policy optimization ‚Üí Aligned model
```

### Text Generation Process

**Autoregressive Generation:**
1. Start with prompt
2. Generate next token probability distribution
3. Sample or select most likely token
4. Add to sequence and repeat
5. Continue until stopping condition

**Example:**
```
Prompt: "The weather today is"
Step 1: "The weather today is" ‚Üí "sunny" (95% probability)
Step 2: "The weather today is sunny" ‚Üí "and" (60% probability)
Step 3: "The weather today is sunny and" ‚Üí "warm" (70% probability)
Result: "The weather today is sunny and warm"
```

## üéØ Generation Strategies

### Greedy Decoding

**Method:** Always pick the most likely next token

**Pros:**
- Deterministic output
- Fast generation
- Coherent for short sequences

**Cons:**
- Repetitive and boring
- Gets stuck in loops
- No diversity

### Sampling Methods

**Random Sampling:**
```python
# Sample from full probability distribution
next_token = torch.multinomial(probabilities, num_samples=1)
```

**Temperature Scaling:**
```python
# Control randomness
probabilities = torch.softmax(logits / temperature, dim=-1)
# temperature < 1: more focused
# temperature > 1: more random
```

**Top-k Sampling:**
```python
# Only sample from top k tokens
top_k_probs, top_k_indices = torch.topk(probabilities, k=40)
```

**Top-p (Nucleus) Sampling:**
```python
# Sample from tokens that sum to probability p
# More adaptive than top-k
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Practical Implementation

### Using GPT Models

```python
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer

# Load model and tokenizer
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained('gpt2')
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2')

# Add padding token
tokenizer.pad_token = tokenizer.eos_token

# Generate text
def generate_text(prompt, max_length=100):
    inputs = tokenizer.encode(prompt, return_tensors='pt')
    
    with torch.no_grad():
        outputs = model.generate(
            inputs,
            max_length=max_length,
            num_return_sequences=1,
            temperature=0.7,
            do_sample=True,
            top_p=0.9,
            pad_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id
        )
    
    return tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

# Example usage
prompt = "The future of artificial intelligence is"
generated = generate_text(prompt)
print(generated)
```

### OpenAI API Usage

```python
import openai

# Set API key
openai.api_key = "your-api-key"

# Generate with GPT-3.5/GPT-4
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Explain quantum computing simply."}
    ],
    max_tokens=150,
    temperature=0.7
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

## üé® Advanced Techniques

### Few-Shot Learning

**Concept:** Provide examples in the prompt to guide behavior

**Example:**
```
Translate English to French:
English: Hello
French: Bonjour

English: Thank you
French: Merci

English: Good morning
French: Bon matin
```

### Chain-of-Thought Prompting

**Method:** Ask model to think step-by-step

**Example:**
```
Question: If a shirt costs $20 and is on sale for 25% off, what's the final price?

Let me think step by step:
1. The discount is 25% of $20 = 0.25 √ó $20 = $5
2. The final price is $20 - $5 = $15

Answer: $15
```

### Instruction Following

**Modern Approach:** Train models to follow instructions

**Example:**
```
System: You are a helpful, harmless, and honest assistant.
User: Write a Python function to calculate factorial.
Assistant: Here's a Python function to calculate factorial:

def factorial(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)
```
