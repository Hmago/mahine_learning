# Text Classification & Sentiment Analysis

Welcome to the exciting world of text classification! This is where you'll build your first real NLP applications that can automatically categorize text and understand emotions and opinions.

## üéØ Why This Matters

Imagine having a personal assistant that can:
- Read thousands of customer reviews and tell you what people think about your product
- Sort your emails into categories automatically
- Analyze social media to understand public opinion about your brand
- Route customer support tickets to the right department

This is the power of text classification!

## üìö What You'll Learn

This module covers two major areas:

### 1. **Classification Algorithms for Text** ü§ñ
- How different machine learning algorithms work with text data
- When to use traditional ML vs. neural networks for text
- Handling multi-class and multi-label classification problems
- Dealing with imbalanced datasets (when some categories have very few examples)

### 2. **Sentiment Analysis & Opinion Mining** üí≠
- Understanding emotions and opinions in text
- Building systems that can detect positive, negative, and neutral sentiment
- Advanced techniques like aspect-based sentiment analysis
- Handling sarcasm and context-dependent sentiment

## üí° Real-World Applications

**Here's why these skills are in high demand:**

### Business Intelligence
- **Customer Feedback Analysis**: Automatically analyze thousands of reviews to understand what customers love and hate
- **Brand Monitoring**: Track mentions of your brand across social media and news
- **Market Research**: Understand public opinion about competitors and industry trends
- **Risk Assessment**: Monitor news and social media for potential business risks

### Customer Service
- **Ticket Routing**: Automatically direct customer inquiries to the right department
- **Priority Detection**: Identify urgent or angry customer messages that need immediate attention
- **FAQ Automation**: Classify common questions and provide automatic responses
- **Satisfaction Monitoring**: Track customer satisfaction trends over time

### Content Management
- **Content Categorization**: Automatically tag and organize articles, documents, and media
- **Quality Control**: Detect inappropriate or low-quality content automatically
- **Personalization**: Understand user preferences to recommend relevant content
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Ensure content meets regulatory and policy requirements

## üõ† Tools and Techniques You'll Master

### Traditional Machine Learning
- **Naive Bayes**: Perfect for text classification, handles features well
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Excellent for text, works well with high-dimensional data
- **Logistic Regression**: Fast, interpretable, great baseline
- **Random Forest**: Handles multiple features, less prone to overfitting

### Modern Approaches
- **Neural Networks**: CNNs and RNNs specifically designed for text
- **Transformer Models**: BERT, RoBERTa for state-of-the-art performance
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combining multiple models for better accuracy
- **Deep Learning**: When you have lots of data and need maximum accuracy

### Evaluation and Optimization
- **Cross-validation**: Ensuring your model works on new data
- **Confusion matrices**: Understanding what your model gets right and wrong
- **Precision, Recall, F1-score**: Choosing the right metrics for your problem
- **Hyperparameter tuning**: Getting the best performance from your models

## üéØ Success Metrics

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- [ ] Build text classifiers that achieve 85%+ accuracy on real datasets
- [ ] Choose the right algorithm for different text classification problems
- [ ] Build sentiment analysis systems for product reviews, social media, and customer feedback
- [ ] Handle imbalanced datasets where some categories are much rarer than others
- [ ] Evaluate and improve your models systematically
- [ ] Deploy text classification models to solve real business problems

## ‚ö° Quick Start Preview

Here's a taste of what you'll build:

```python
# A simple sentiment classifier
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline

# Create a sentiment analysis pipeline
sentiment_pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('tfidf', TfidfVectorizer(ngram_range=(1, 2), max_features=5000)),
    ('classifier', MultinomialNB())
])

# Training data
reviews = [
    "This movie is absolutely amazing! Love it!",
    "Terrible film, wasted my time",
    "Great acting and wonderful story",
    "Boring and poorly made"
]
sentiments = ["positive", "negative", "positive", "negative"]

# Train the model
sentiment_pipeline.fit(reviews, sentiments)

# Predict sentiment for new reviews
new_reviews = ["This is the best movie ever!", "I didn't like it at all"]
predictions = sentiment_pipeline.predict(new_reviews)
print(predictions)  # ['positive', 'negative']
```
