# Information Extraction & Named Entity Recognition

Welcome to the world of information extraction! This is where you'll learn to automatically find and extract structured information from unstructured text - like turning a messy pile of documents into an organized database.

## üéØ Why This Matters

Imagine you have thousands of documents and need to extract specific information like:
- **From news articles**: Who did what, when, and where?
- **From resumes**: Names, skills, work experience, education
- **From medical records**: Symptoms, treatments, medications, dates
- **From legal documents**: Parties involved, dates, monetary amounts, obligations

Doing this manually would take forever. Information extraction automates this process!

## üïµÔ∏è What is Information Extraction?

Think of information extraction as being a detective with a highlighter and filing system. You scan through text to:

1. **Find important entities** (people, places, organizations, dates)
2. **Identify relationships** between these entities
3. **Extract structured facts** from unstructured text
4. **Organize information** into databases or knowledge graphs

**Real-world analogy:** It's like having a super-smart assistant that can read through all your emails, documents, and reports, then automatically create a spreadsheet with all the important facts organized by category.

## üìö What You'll Learn

### 1. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** üè∑Ô∏è
- **Standard Entities**: Person, Organization, Location, Date, Money
- **Custom Entities**: Domain-specific entities for your business
- **Nested Entities**: Handling complex, overlapping entity types
- **Entity Linking**: Connecting entities to knowledge bases

### 2. **Relation Extraction** üîó
- **Binary Relations**: Simple relationships between two entities
- **Complex Relations**: Multi-entity relationships and event structures
- **Temporal Relations**: Understanding time-based relationships
- **Causal Relations**: Identifying cause-and-effect relationships

### 3. **Advanced Extraction** üß†
- **Event Extraction**: Who did what, when, where, and why
- **Template Filling**: Extracting information into structured forms
- **Knowledge Graph Construction**: Building networks of related information
- **Information Integration**: Combining information from multiple sources

## ‚ö° Quick Start Preview

Here's what you'll be building:

```python
# Named Entity Recognition with spaCy
import spacy

# Load pre-trained model
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

# Process text
text = "Apple Inc. was founded by Steve Jobs in Cupertino, California in 1976."
doc = nlp(text)

# Extract entities
for ent in doc.ents:
    print(f"{ent.text} ({ent.label_}) - {ent._.description}")

# Output:
# Apple Inc. (ORG) - Companies, agencies, institutions
# Steve Jobs (PERSON) - People, including fictional
# Cupertino (GPE) - Countries, cities, states
# California (GPE) - Countries, cities, states  
# 1976 (DATE) - Absolute or relative dates or periods
```

```python
# Custom NER for specific domain
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForTokenClassification
from transformers import pipeline

# Load custom model trained for medical entities
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("medical-ner-model")
model = AutoModelForTokenClassification.from_pretrained("medical-ner-model")

# Create NER pipeline
ner = pipeline("ner", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)

# Extract medical entities
text = "Patient presents with severe headache and nausea. Prescribed acetaminophen 500mg."
entities = ner(text)

for entity in entities:
    print(f"{entity['word']} - {entity['entity']}")

# Output:
# headache - SYMPTOM
