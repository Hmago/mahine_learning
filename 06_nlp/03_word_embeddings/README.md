# Word Embeddings & Semantic Representations

Welcome to the fascinating world of word embeddings! This is where text analysis becomes truly intelligent - instead of just counting words, you'll learn how to understand their meanings and relationships.

## üéØ Why This Matters

Traditional approaches like Bag of Words treat words as isolated tokens. But humans understand that:
- "king" and "queen" are related (both royalty)
- "happy" and "joyful" mean similar things  
- "Paris" and "France" have a geographic relationship

Word embeddings capture these semantic relationships in numbers, allowing machines to understand meaning rather than just matching exact words!

## üß† What Are Word Embeddings?

Think of word embeddings as a GPS system for language. Just like GPS converts addresses into coordinates that show distance and direction, embeddings convert words into numerical coordinates that show semantic similarity and relationships.

**Real-world analogy:** 
- If "king" is at coordinates (2.1, 5.7, -1.3)
- Then "queen" might be at (2.2, 5.8, -1.1) - very close!
- While "bicycle" might be at (-4.2, 1.1, 3.8) - much farther away

## ‚ö° Quick Start Preview

Here's a taste of the magic you'll learn:

```python
# Using Word2Vec to find similar words
from gensim.models import Word2Vec

# Train on your text data
model = Word2Vec(sentences, vector_size=100, window=5, min_count=1)

# Find words similar to "king"
similar_words = model.wv.most_similar("king", topn=5)
print(similar_words)
# [('queen', 0.87), ('prince', 0.82), ('royal', 0.78), ...]

# Solve analogies: king - man + woman = ?
result = model.wv.most_similar(positive=['king', 'woman'], negative=['man'])
print(result[0])  # ('queen', 0.89)

# Measure semantic similarity
similarity = model.wv.similarity('happy', 'joyful')
print(f"Similarity: {similarity}")  # 0.85
```

```python
# Using BERT for contextual understanding
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel
import torch

# Load pre-trained BERT
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

# Get contextual embeddings
text1 = "The bank of the river was muddy"  # Geographic bank
text2 = "I went to the bank to deposit money"  # Financial bank

# BERT understands these are different meanings of "bank"!
```

## üß™ Fascinating Embedding Properties

### Mathematical Relationships
Embeddings capture amazing mathematical relationships:

```python
# Vector arithmetic that actually works!
king - man + woman ‚âà queen
Paris - France + Italy ‚âà Rome
walking - walk + swim ‚âà swimming
```

### Semantic Clustering
Words with similar meanings cluster together in embedding space:
- **Emotions**: happy, joyful, delighted, cheerful
- **Colors**: red, blue, green, yellow, purple
- **Animals**: cat, dog, bird, fish, elephant

### Cultural and Contextual Understanding
Modern embeddings understand context and culture:
- "bank" near "river" vs "bank" near "money"
- "apple" as fruit vs "Apple" as company
- Cultural concepts and references
