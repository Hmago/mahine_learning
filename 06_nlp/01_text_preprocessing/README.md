# Text Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

Welcome to the foundation of Natural Language Processing! This module covers how to transform raw, messy text into clean, structured data that machines can understand and process.

## üéØ Why This Matters

Imagine you're trying to read a book, but every page has:
- Random CAPITAL LETTERS mixed with lowercase
- Spelling mistakes and typos everywhere
- No spaces between words
- Random symbols and emojis scattered around
- Different languages mixed together

You'd struggle to understand it, right? Well, computers have the same problem with raw text data! Text preprocessing is like being a professional editor who cleans up the text so both humans and machines can understand it better.

## üìö What You'll Learn

This module is divided into two main areas:

### 1. **Text Cleaning & Normalization** üìù
- How to clean messy text data (like social media posts, web scraping results)
- Converting text into a consistent format
- Breaking text into meaningful pieces (words, sentences)
- Handling different languages and special characters

### 2. **Feature Extraction Methods** üîç
- Converting cleaned text into numbers that machines can work with
- Understanding how computers "see" text
- Creating meaningful representations of documents
- Selecting the most important features for your task

2. **Next**: [Advanced Text Cleaning](./02_advanced_text_cleaning.md)
3. **Then**: [Tokenization Strategies](./03_tokenization.md)
4. **Continue**: [Text Normalization](./04_text_normalization.md)
5. **Move to**: [Bag of Words & TF-IDF](./05_bag_of_words_tfidf.md)
6. **Advanced**: [N-grams & Feature Selection](./06_ngrams_feature_selection.md)
7. **Practice**: [Hands-on Exercises](./07_exercises.md)

## üí° Real-World Applications

**Before you start, here's why this matters in the real world:**

- **Social Media Analysis**: Clean tweets and posts to understand public opinion
- **Customer Reviews**: Process product reviews to find common complaints or praise
- **Search Engines**: Prepare web content so search results are relevant
- **Chatbots**: Clean user messages so the bot understands what people are asking
- **Email Filtering**: Preprocess emails to detect spam or categorize them
- **Document Classification**: Prepare legal documents, medical records, or news articles for automatic sorting

## üõ† Tools You'll Use

Don't worry if you haven't used these before - we'll introduce them gradually:

- **Python**: Our main programming language
- **NLTK**: A comprehensive toolkit for text processing
- **spaCy**: Industrial-strength text processing
- **Pandas**: For handling text data in tables
- **Regular Expressions (regex)**: For pattern matching in text

## üéØ Success Metrics

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- [ ] Take any messy text and clean it systematically
- [ ] Choose the right preprocessing steps for different types of text
- [ ] Convert text into numerical features for machine learning
- [ ] Build a complete text preprocessing pipeline
- [ ] Handle real-world text challenges (multiple languages, social media text, HTML content)

## ‚ö° Quick Start

If you're eager to dive in, here's a taste of what you'll learn:

```python
# Raw, messy text
text = "OMG!!! This movie is AMAZING üòç http://example.com #bestmovie"

# After preprocessing
clean_text = "movie amazing"

# Converted to numbers for machine learning
numbers = [0.5, 0.8, 0.0, 0.3, ...]  # Each number represents a word's importance
```
