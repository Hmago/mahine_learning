# Linear Algebra with NumPy: The Mathematics Behind Machine Learning

## 🤔 Why Linear Algebra? (The Simple Answer)

Imagine you're running a business with thousands of customers and dozens of features (age, income, spending, etc.). How do you find patterns? How do you predict customer behavior?

**Linear algebra is the language machines use to understand relationships in data.**

Think of it like this:
- **Vectors**: A customer's profile (age=30, income=50k, spending=2k)
- **Matrices**: All your customers' profiles in one organized table
- **Operations**: Ways to find similarities, patterns, and predictions

## 🎯 Essential Linear Algebra Operations

### 1. Vectors: Single Customer Profiles

```python
import numpy as np

# A customer's profile as a vector
customer_a = np.array([30, 50000, 2000])  # [age, income, annual_spending]
customer_b = np.array([25, 45000, 1800])

# Vector operations that reveal insights
difference = customer_a - customer_b  # How different are they?
similarity = np.dot(customer_a, customer_b)  # How similar are they?
distance = np.linalg.norm(customer_a - customer_b)  # How far apart?

print(f"Customer A: {customer_a}")
print(f"Customer B: {customer_b}")
print(f"Difference: {difference}")
print(f"Similarity score: {similarity}")
print(f"Distance: {distance:.2f}")
```

**Business insight**: Customers with smaller distances are more similar and might respond to the same marketing campaigns.

### 2. Matrices: Your Entire Customer Database

```python
# Customer database as a matrix (rows=customers, columns=features)
customer_matrix = np.array([
    [30, 50000, 2000],  # Customer 0
    [25, 45000, 1800],  # Customer 1
    [35, 75000, 3500],  # Customer 2
    [28, 55000, 2200],  # Customer 3
    [42, 90000, 4500]   # Customer 4
])

print(f"Database shape: {customer_matrix.shape}")
print(f"We have {customer_matrix.shape[0]} customers")
print(f"Each has {customer_matrix.shape[1]} features")

# Get all ages (first column)
all_ages = customer_matrix[:, 0]
print(f"Age range: {all_ages.min()} to {all_ages.max()}")

# Get specific customer (row)
customer_2 = customer_matrix[2]
print(f"Customer 2 profile: {customer_2}")
```

### 3. Matrix Multiplication: Finding Relationships

```python
# Customer features matrix
customers = np.array([
    [30, 50000],  # [age, income]
    [25, 45000],
    [35, 75000],
    [28, 55000]
])

# Feature weights (learned from historical data)
# How much does age and income influence spending?
weights = np.array([10, 0.04])  # $10 per year of age, $0.04 per dollar of income

# Predict spending using matrix multiplication
predicted_spending = np.dot(customers, weights)

print("Spending predictions:")
for i, (customer, prediction) in enumerate(zip(customers, predicted_spending)):
    print(f"Customer {i}: Age {customer[0]}, Income ${customer[1]} → Predicted: ${prediction:.2f}")
```

**This is exactly how linear regression works!**

## 🏦 Real-World Example: Credit Scoring System

```python
# Credit scoring using linear algebra
def build_credit_score_system():
    # Sample customer data: [income, debt, credit_history_years, payment_delays]
    customers = np.array([
        [60000, 15000, 5, 2],   # Customer 0
        [45000, 25000, 3, 5],   # Customer 1
        [80000, 10000, 8, 0],   # Customer 2
        [35000, 30000, 2, 8],   # Customer 3
        [95000, 5000, 12, 1]    # Customer 4
    ])
    
    # Scoring weights (learned from historical data)
    # [income_weight, debt_weight, history_weight, delay_penalty]
    weights = np.array([0.01, -0.02, 50, -25])
    
    # Calculate credit scores using matrix multiplication
    base_scores = np.dot(customers, weights)
    
    # Normalize to 300-850 range (typical credit score range)
    min_score, max_score = base_scores.min(), base_scores.max()
    credit_scores = 300 + (base_scores - min_score) / (max_score - min_score) * 550
    
    # Categorize customers
    excellent = credit_scores >= 750
    good = (credit_scores >= 670) & (credit_scores < 750)
    fair = (credit_scores >= 580) & (credit_scores < 670)
    poor = credit_scores < 580
    
    print("Credit Score Analysis:")
    print(f"Excellent credit (≥750): {excellent.sum()} customers")
    print(f"Good credit (670-749): {good.sum()} customers")
    print(f"Fair credit (580-669): {fair.sum()} customers")
    print(f"Poor credit (<580): {poor.sum()} customers")
    
    return credit_scores

credit_scores = build_credit_score_system()
```

## 🎭 Advanced Operations: The Machine Learning Toolkit

### 1. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors: Finding the Most Important Patterns

```python
# Customer correlation analysis
# Features: [age, income, spending, loyalty_score]
np.random.seed(42)
customer_features = np.random.rand(1000, 4) * np.array([50, 100000, 5000, 10])

# Calculate correlation matrix
correlation_matrix = np.corrcoef(customer_features.T)

# Find principal components (most important patterns)
eigenvalues, eigenvectors = np.linalg.eig(correlation_matrix)

# Sort by importance
idx = eigenvalues.argsort()[::-1]
eigenvalues = eigenvalues[idx]
eigenvectors = eigenvectors[:, idx]

print("Most important patterns in customer data:")
for i, (value, vector) in enumerate(zip(eigenvalues, eigenvectors.T)):
    print(f"Pattern {i+1}: Importance={value:.3f}")
    print(f"  Feature weights: {vector}")
    print()
```

**What this tells you**: Which combinations of customer features are most important for predicting behavior.

### 2. Matrix Decomposition: Recommendation Systems

```python
# Simple movie recommendation system using SVD
# Matrix: users × movies, values = ratings

# Sample movie ratings (5 users × 4 movies)
user_ratings = np.array([
    [5, 3, 0, 1],  # User 0 ratings
    [4, 0, 0, 1],  # User 1 ratings
    [1, 1, 0, 5],  # User 2 ratings
    [1, 0, 0, 4],  # User 3 ratings
    [0, 1, 5, 4]   # User 4 ratings
])

# Singular Value Decomposition
U, s, Vt = np.linalg.svd(user_ratings, full_matrices=False)

# Reconstruct with reduced dimensions (compression)
k = 2  # Keep top 2 components
reconstructed = U[:, :k] @ np.diag(s[:k]) @ Vt[:k, :]

print("Original ratings:")
print(user_ratings)
print("\nReconstructed ratings (filled missing values):")
print(reconstructed.round(2))
```

**Business value**: Fill in missing ratings to recommend movies to users!

### 3. Solving Systems: Business Optimization

```python
# Business problem: Optimal resource allocation
# You have 3 products and need to determine optimal production levels

# Constraints matrix (resources needed per product)
# [labor_hours, material_cost, machine_time] per unit
constraints = np.array([
    [2, 30, 1],    # Product A needs 2 hours, $30 materials, 1 machine hour
    [3, 20, 2],    # Product B needs 3 hours, $20 materials, 2 machine hours
    [1, 50, 1]     # Product C needs 1 hour, $50 materials, 1 machine hour
])

# Available resources
available_resources = np.array([1000, 50000, 500])  # [hours, $, machine_hours]

# Solve for production levels
try:
    production_levels = np.linalg.solve(constraints, available_resources)
    print("Optimal production levels:")
    print(f"Product A: {production_levels[0]:.1f} units")
    print(f"Product B: {production_levels[1]:.1f} units")
    print(f"Product C: {production_levels[2]:.1f} units")
except np.linalg.LinAlgError:
    print("No exact solution exists - need optimization techniques")
```

## 🎮 Practical Exercise: Customer Similarity Engine

Build a system to find similar customers:

```python
import numpy as np

def find_similar_customers():
    # Generate realistic customer data
    np.random.seed(42)
    n_customers = 1000
    
    # Features: [age, income, spending, frequency, recency]
    customers = np.random.rand(n_customers, 5) * np.array([50, 100000, 5000, 100, 365])
    customers[:, 0] += 20  # Age: 20-70
    
    # Normalize features (important for distance calculations)
    normalized_customers = (customers - customers.mean(axis=0)) / customers.std(axis=0)
    
    def find_similar(customer_id, top_k=5):
        # Get target customer
        target = normalized_customers[customer_id]
        
        # Calculate distances to all other customers
        distances = np.linalg.norm(normalized_customers - target, axis=1)
        
        # Find most similar customers (excluding self)
        distances[customer_id] = np.inf  # Exclude self
        similar_indices = np.argsort(distances)[:top_k]
        
        return similar_indices, distances[similar_indices]
    
    # Example: Find customers similar to customer 0
    similar_ids, distances = find_similar(0)
    
    print(f"Customer 0 profile: {customers[0]}")
    print(f"\nTop 5 similar customers:")
    for i, (sim_id, distance) in enumerate(zip(similar_ids, distances)):
        print(f"{i+1}. Customer {sim_id}: distance={distance:.3f}")
        print(f"   Profile: {customers[sim_id]}")
        print()

find_similar_customers()
```

## 🎯 Performance Tips for Large-Scale Operations

### 1. Memory Management

```python
# For large datasets, consider data types
large_dataset = np.random.rand(10000, 1000).astype(np.float32)  # Use float32 instead of float64
print(f"Memory usage: {large_dataset.nbytes / 1024**2:.1f} MB")

# Use views instead of copies when possible
subset = large_dataset[:1000]  # This is a view (no copy)
subset_copy = large_dataset[:1000].copy()  # This is a copy (uses more memory)
```

### 2. Efficient Operations

```python
# Efficient statistical calculations
data = np.random.rand(1000000)

# All at once (efficient)
stats = {
    'mean': np.mean(data),
    'std': np.std(data),
    'min': np.min(data),
    'max': np.max(data)
}

# Or use built-in combinations
percentiles = np.percentile(data, [25, 50, 75])  # Quartiles
```

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

1. **Vectors and matrices represent data**: Think of them as organized tables of information
2. **Operations reveal insights**: Dot products show similarity, norms show magnitude
3. **Decompositions find patterns**: SVD, eigenvalues reveal hidden structure
4. **Solving systems optimizes business**: Find optimal resource allocation
5. **Everything is interconnected**: These operations power all machine learning algorithms
