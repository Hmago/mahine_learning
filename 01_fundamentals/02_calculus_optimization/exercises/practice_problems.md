## Practice Problems for Calculus and Optimization

### Problem 1: Derivatives
Given the function f(x) = 3x^3 - 5x^2 + 2x - 7, calculate the first derivative f'(x) and evaluate it at x = 2.

### Problem 2: Gradient Calculation
Consider the function g(x, y) = x^2 + y^2. Compute the gradient ∇g at the point (3, 4).

### Problem 3: Optimization
You are given the function h(x) = -2x^2 + 4x + 1. Find the value of x that maximizes h(x) using the first derivative test.

### Problem 4: Multivariable Optimization
Given the function k(x, y) = x^2 + 2y^2 - 4x - 8y, find the critical points and determine whether they are minima, maxima, or saddle points using the second derivative test.

### Problem 5: Gradient Descent
Implement a simple gradient descent algorithm to minimize the function f(x) = (x - 3)^2. Start with an initial guess of x = 0 and use a learning rate of 0.1. Perform 10 iterations and report the final value of x.

### Problem 6: Lagrange Multipliers
Use Lagrange multipliers to find the maximum and minimum values of the function m(x, y) = xy subject to the constraint x^2 + y^2 = 25.

### Problem 7: Taylor Series
Find the Taylor series expansion of the function p(x) = e^x around x = 0 up to the 4th degree.

### Problem 8: Loss Function
Consider a simple linear regression model with the loss function defined as L(w) = Σ(y_i - (wx_i + b))^2. Explain how you would use calculus to find the optimal values of w and b.

### Problem 9: Constrained Optimization
Explain the concept of constrained optimization and provide an example where it is applicable in machine learning.

### Problem 10: Real-World Application
Discuss a real-world scenario where optimization techniques are crucial in machine learning, such as training a neural network. What role does calculus play in this process?
