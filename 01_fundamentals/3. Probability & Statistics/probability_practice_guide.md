## üìä Practice Section 1: Probability Calculations

### Exercise 1.1: Conditional Probability
**Scenario**: Email Classification System

Given:
- 60% of emails are legitimate
- 40% of emails are spam
- 80% of spam emails contain the word "urgent"
- 5% of legitimate emails contain the word "urgent"

**Questions**:
1. What's the probability an email contains "urgent"?
2. If an email contains "urgent", what's the probability it's spam?
3. If an email doesn't contain "urgent", what's the probability it's legitimate?

**Solution Approach**:
```
Let S = Spam, L = Legitimate, U = Contains "urgent"

Given:
P(L) = 0.6, P(S) = 0.4
P(U|S) = 0.8, P(U|L) = 0.05

1. P(U) = P(U|S)P(S) + P(U|L)P(L) = 0.8√ó0.4 + 0.05√ó0.6 = 0.35

2. P(S|U) = P(U|S)P(S) / P(U) = (0.8√ó0.4) / 0.35 = 0.914

3. P(L|U') = P(U'|L)P(L) / P(U') = (0.95√ó0.6) / 0.65 = 0.877
```

### Exercise 1.2: Multiple Conditions
**Scenario**: Medical Diagnosis

A diagnostic test has:
- Sensitivity (True Positive Rate): 95%
- Specificity (True Negative Rate): 90%
- Disease prevalence: 2%

**Challenge**: Calculate the positive predictive value (precision)

### Exercise 1.3: Chain Rule Application
**Scenario**: Sequential Decision Making

- P(Click‚ÇÉ|Click‚ÇÅ,Click‚ÇÇ) = 0.8, P(Click‚ÇÉ|Click‚ÇÅ,¬¨Click‚ÇÇ) = 0.4
