## Gradient Descent Regression Project

### Overview
This project focuses on implementing gradient descent for linear regression. Gradient descent is a powerful optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost function in machine learning models. By understanding how gradient descent works, you will gain insights into how models learn from data and adjust their parameters to improve predictions.

### Importance of Gradient Descent
Gradient descent is crucial in machine learning because it allows models to learn from data iteratively. Instead of trying to find the optimal parameters in one go, gradient descent updates the parameters gradually, making it suitable for large datasets and complex models. This project will help you understand the mechanics behind this optimization technique and its application in regression tasks.

### Project Goals
- Implement gradient descent from scratch to optimize a linear regression model.
- Understand the cost function and how it influences the learning process.
- Visualize the convergence of the gradient descent algorithm.
- Evaluate the performance of the regression model using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE).

### Key Concepts Covered
- **Linear Regression**: A statistical method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
- **Cost Function**: A function that measures the error between predicted and actual values. The goal is to minimize this function.
- **Learning Rate**: A hyperparameter that determines the size of the steps taken towards the minimum of the cost function during optimization.
- **Convergence**: The process of approaching a limit or the optimal solution in the context of optimization.

### Practical Applications
- Predicting housing prices based on various features (e.g., size, location, number of rooms).
- Estimating sales based on advertising spend across different channels.
- Forecasting stock prices based on historical data.
