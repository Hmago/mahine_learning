## Practice Problems: Bias-Variance Tradeoff

### Problem 1: Understanding Bias and Variance
1. Define bias and variance in your own words.
2. Provide an example of a model that has high bias and explain why it underfits the data.
3. Provide an example of a model that has high variance and explain why it overfits the data.

### Problem 2: Bias-Variance Tradeoff
1. Explain the bias-variance tradeoff in the context of model performance.
2. Create a diagram that illustrates the relationship between bias, variance, and model complexity.
3. Discuss how you would choose a model based on the bias-variance tradeoff.

### Problem 3: Model Evaluation
1. Given a dataset, describe how you would evaluate the performance of a model in terms of bias and variance.
2. What metrics would you use to assess whether a model is underfitting or overfitting?

### Problem 4: Regularization Techniques
1. Explain what regularization is and how it helps in managing the bias-variance tradeoff.
2. Compare and contrast L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization techniques. When would you use one over the other?

### Problem 5: Practical Application
1. Choose a dataset (e.g., from Kaggle) and train a simple linear regression model and a more complex polynomial regression model.
2. Analyze the results and discuss the bias-variance tradeoff observed in your models.
3. Suggest ways to improve the model performance based on your analysis.

### Problem 6: Real-World Scenarios
1. Describe a real-world scenario where understanding the bias-variance tradeoff is crucial for model selection.
2. How would you communicate the importance of this tradeoff to a non-technical stakeholder?

### Additional Exercises
- Create a small simulation to visualize the effects of bias and variance on model performance.
- Write a short essay on the importance of the bias-variance tradeoff in machine learning and its implications for model selection and evaluation.
