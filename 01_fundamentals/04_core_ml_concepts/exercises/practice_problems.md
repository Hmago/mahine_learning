## Practice Problems for Core ML Concepts

### Problem 1: Supervised Learning
**Question:** Define supervised learning and provide two examples of supervised learning algorithms. Explain how they differ in their approach.

### Problem 2: Unsupervised Learning
**Question:** What is unsupervised learning? Describe a scenario where unsupervised learning would be more appropriate than supervised learning.

### Problem 3: Reinforcement Learning
**Question:** Explain the concept of reinforcement learning. How does it differ from supervised and unsupervised learning? Provide a real-world application of reinforcement learning.

### Problem 4: Semi-Supervised Learning
**Question:** What is semi-supervised learning? Discuss its advantages and when it might be used in practice.

### Problem 5: Evaluation Metrics
**Question:** List and explain three evaluation metrics used in supervised learning. Why is it important to choose the right evaluation metric for a given problem?

### Problem 6: Clustering Techniques
**Question:** Describe two clustering algorithms. How do they differ in terms of their methodology and use cases?

### Problem 7: Model Selection
**Question:** What factors should be considered when selecting a model for a machine learning task? Discuss the importance of cross-validation in this process.

### Problem 8: Real-World Application
**Question:** Choose a real-world problem that could be solved using machine learning. Identify whether it is a supervised, unsupervised, or reinforcement learning problem and justify your choice.

### Additional Exercises
- Create a flowchart that illustrates the decision-making process for selecting a machine learning model based on the problem type.
