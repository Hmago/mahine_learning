# 04 - Core ML Concepts

## Overview

Core machine learning concepts form the backbone of any successful ML project. Understanding these concepts is crucial for effectively applying machine learning techniques to real-world problems. This section will introduce you to the fundamental types of learning in ML, including supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement, and semi-supervised learning.

## Why Does This Matter?

Machine learning is not just about algorithms; it's about understanding the types of problems you can solve with them. By grasping these core concepts, you'll be better equipped to choose the right approach for your specific data and objectives. This knowledge will also help you communicate effectively with stakeholders and make informed decisions throughout the ML lifecycle.

## Topics Covered

1. **Supervised Learning**: Learn how to train models on labeled data to make predictions or classifications.
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Explore techniques for finding patterns in data without predefined labels.
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Understand how agents learn to make decisions through trial and error in dynamic environments.
4. **Semi-supervised Learning**: Discover methods that combine labeled and unlabeled data to improve learning outcomes.

## Suggested Learning Path

1. Start with **Supervised Learning** to understand the most common ML approach.
2. Move on to **Unsupervised Learning** to explore data clustering and association.
3. Dive into **Reinforcement Learning** for a deeper understanding of decision-making processes.
4. Finally, study **Semi-supervised Learning** to learn how to leverage both labeled and unlabeled data effectively.

## Practical Exercises

- Implement a simple supervised learning model using a dataset of your choice.
- Experiment with clustering techniques on an unlabeled dataset.
- Create a reinforcement learning agent to solve a basic game or task.
- Analyze a dataset with both labeled and unlabeled examples using semi-supervised techniques.

By the end of this section, you will have a solid understanding of core ML concepts and be ready to apply them in practical scenarios.
