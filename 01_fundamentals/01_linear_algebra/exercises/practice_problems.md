# Practice Problems for Linear Algebra

## Problem Set 1: Vectors
1. **Vector Addition**: Given two vectors **A** = [3, 4] and **B** = [1, 2], calculate the resultant vector **C** = **A** + **B**.
   
2. **Dot Product**: Calculate the dot product of the vectors **A** = [2, 3] and **B** = [4, 5].

3. **Cross Product**: For vectors **A** = [1, 2, 3] and **B** = [4, 5, 6], compute the cross product **C** = **A** × **B**.

## Problem Set 2: Matrices
1. **Matrix Multiplication**: Multiply the following matrices:
   - **Matrix A** = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
   - **Matrix B** = [[5, 6], [7, 8]]

2. **Matrix Transpose**: Given the matrix **A** = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], find the transpose of **A**.

3. **Determinant Calculation**: Calculate the determinant of the matrix:
   - **Matrix A** = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]

## Problem Set 3: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
1. **Eigenvalue Problem**: For the matrix **A** = [[4, 2], [1, 3]], find the eigenvalues.

2. **Eigenvector Calculation**: Using the eigenvalues found in the previous problem, calculate the corresponding eigenvectors.

## Problem Set 4: Vector Spaces
1. **Linear Independence**: Determine if the vectors **A** = [1, 2] and **B** = [2, 4] are linearly independent.

2. **Span**: Given the vectors **A** = [1, 0] and **B** = [0, 1], describe the span of these vectors in R².

## Problem Set 5: Practical Applications
1. **Image Compression**: Using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), explain how you would compress an image represented as a matrix.

2. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Discuss how eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be used in Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.
