    "\n",
    "Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data, where the input data is paired with the correct output. Common tasks include classification and regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise:\n",
    "- Load a dataset (e.g., Iris dataset) and implement a simple classification model using scikit-learn.\n",
    "- Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy and confusion matrix."

    "Unsupervised learning deals with data that does not have labeled responses. The goal is to identify patterns or groupings within the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise:\n",
    "- Use K-means clustering on a dataset (e.g., customer data) to identify distinct groups.\n",
    "- Visualize the clusters using a scatter plot."

    "Reinforcement learning involves training an agent to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise:\n",
    "- Implement a simple reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning) to solve a grid-world problem.\n",

    "Semi-supervised learning combines a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data during training. This approach is useful when labeling data is expensive or time-consuming.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise:\n",
    "- Experiment with a semi-supervised learning algorithm (e.g., self-training) on a dataset with limited labels.\n",
