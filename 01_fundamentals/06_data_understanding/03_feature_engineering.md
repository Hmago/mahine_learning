# Feature Engineering in Machine Learning

## What is Feature Engineering?

Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge to select, modify, or create features (input variables) that make machine learning algorithms work better. It is a crucial step in the machine learning pipeline because the quality of the features directly impacts the performance of the model.

## Why Does This Matter?

Good features can significantly improve the accuracy of your model. Conversely, poor features can lead to misleading results and poor predictions. Feature engineering helps in transforming raw data into a format that is more suitable for machine learning algorithms.

## Key Concepts in Feature Engineering

### 1. Feature Creation
This involves generating new features from existing ones. For example, if you have a date feature, you might create new features such as the day of the week, month, or year.

**Example:**
If you have a date column in your dataset, you can extract the month and day as separate features.

### 2. Feature Selection
This is the process of selecting a subset of relevant features for use in model construction. It helps in reducing the dimensionality of the data and improving model performance.

**Example:**
Using techniques like Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) or feature importance from tree-based models to select the most impactful features.

### 3. Feature Transformation
Transforming features can help in normalizing the data or making it more suitable for modeling. Common transformations include scaling, encoding categorical variables, and applying mathematical functions.

**Example:**
- **Scaling**: Normalizing features to a range (e.g., 0 to 1) using Min-Max scaling.
- **Encoding**: Converting categorical variables into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding.

### 4. Handling Missing Values
Missing data can skew results and lead to inaccurate predictions. Feature engineering includes strategies for dealing with missing values, such as imputation or creating a new feature that indicates whether a value was missing.

**Example:**
If a feature has missing values, you might fill them with the mean or median of that feature or create a binary feature indicating whether the value was missing.

### 5. Interaction Features
Creating features that capture the interaction between two or more features can sometimes improve model performance.

**Example:**
If you have features for "height" and "weight," creating a new feature for "BMI" (Body Mass Index) can provide additional insights.

## Practical Exercises

1. **Create New Features**: Take a dataset and create new features from existing ones. For example, if you have a dataset with timestamps, extract the hour, day, and month as new features.

2. **Select Features**: Use a feature selection technique on a dataset to identify the most important features for your model.

3. **Transform Features**: Apply scaling to a dataset and observe how it affects the performance of a machine learning model.

4. **Handle Missing Values**: Experiment with different strategies for handling missing values in a dataset and evaluate their impact on model performance.

## Conclusion

Feature engineering is a vital skill in machine learning that can greatly influence the success of your models. By understanding and applying the concepts of feature creation, selection, transformation, and handling missing values, you can enhance the predictive power of your machine learning algorithms.

### Key Formulas

**Min-Max Scaling:**
$$x_{scaled} = \frac{x - x_{min}}{x_{max} - x_{min}}$$

**Z-Score Normalization:**
$$x_{normalized} = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}$$

**Polynomial Features:**
For features $x_1, x_2$, degree-2 polynomial features include:
$$\{x_1, x_2, x_1^2, x_2^2, x_1x_2\}$$

**Information Gain (Feature Selection):**
$$IG(T, A) = H(T) - H(T|A)$$

Where $H(T) = -\sum_{i} p_i \log_2(p_i)$ is entropy.

**Correlation-Based Feature Selection:**
$$r_{xy} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2}\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \bar{y})^2}}$$

**Principal Component Analysis (Dimensionality Reduction):**
$$PC_1 = a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + ... + a_{1p}x_p$$

Where coefficients maximize variance: $\text{Var}(PC_1) = a_1^T \Sigma a_1$

### Solved Examples

#### Example 1: Feature Scaling Application

Given: House dataset with features:
- Size (sqft): [800, 1200, 2000, 1500, 900]
- Price ($1000s): [150, 280, 450, 320, 180]

Find: Min-Max scaled and Z-score normalized features

Solution:
Step 1: Min-Max scaling for Size
$$x_{min} = 800, \quad x_{max} = 2000$$

For each value:
- $800_{scaled} = \frac{800 - 800}{2000 - 800} = 0$
- $1200_{scaled} = \frac{1200 - 800}{2000 - 800} = 0.33$
- $2000_{scaled} = \frac{2000 - 800}{2000 - 800} = 1$
- $1500_{scaled} = \frac{1500 - 800}{2000 - 800} = 0.58$
- $900_{scaled} = \frac{900 - 800}{2000 - 800} = 0.08$

Step 2: Z-score normalization for Price
$$\mu = \frac{150 + 280 + 450 + 320 + 180}{5} = 276$$
$$\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{(150-276)^2 + (280-276)^2 + (450-276)^2 + (320-276)^2 + (180-276)^2}{4}} = 115.43$$

For each value:
- $150_{norm} = \frac{150 - 276}{115.43} = -1.09$
- $280_{norm} = \frac{280 - 276}{115.43} = 0.03$
- $450_{norm} = \frac{450 - 276}{115.43} = 1.51$
- $320_{norm} = \frac{320 - 276}{115.43} = 0.38$
- $180_{norm} = \frac{180 - 276}{115.43} = -0.83$

Result: Scaled features now have comparable ranges for modeling.

#### Example 2: Polynomial Feature Creation

Given: Dataset with features $x_1$ = [1, 2, 3] and $x_2$ = [4, 5, 6]

Find: Create degree-2 polynomial features

Solution:
Step 1: Original features
$$X = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 4 \\ 2 & 5 \\ 3 & 6 \end{pmatrix}$$

Step 2: Generate polynomial features
For degree-2, create: $\{x_1, x_2, x_1^2, x_2^2, x_1x_2\}$

Step 3: Calculate new features
$$X_{poly} = \begin{pmatrix} 
1 & 4 & 1 & 16 & 4 \\
2 & 5 & 4 & 25 & 10 \\
3 & 6 & 9 & 36 & 18
\end{pmatrix}$$

Result: Original 2 features expanded to 5 polynomial features.

#### Example 3: Information Gain Calculation

Given: Binary classification dataset
Feature A: [1, 1, 0, 0, 1], Target: [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]

Find: Information gain of feature A

Solution:
Step 1: Calculate overall entropy
Class distribution: 3 ones, 2 zeros
$$H(T) = -\frac{3}{5}\log_2\left(\frac{3}{5}\right) - \frac{2}{5}\log_2\left(\frac{2}{5}\right) = 0.971$$

Step 2: Calculate conditional entropy
When A=1: targets = [1, 1, 0] → 2 ones, 1 zero
$$H(T|A=1) = -\frac{2}{3}\log_2\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) - \frac{1}{3}\log_2\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 0.918$$

When A=0: targets = [0, 1] → 1 one, 1 zero  
$$H(T|A=0) = -\frac{1}{2}\log_2\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) - \frac{1}{2}\log_2\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = 1.0$$

Step 3: Calculate weighted conditional entropy
$$H(T|A) = \frac{3}{5} \times 0.918 + \frac{2}{5} \times 1.0 = 0.951$$

Step 4: Calculate information gain
$$IG(T,A) = 0.971 - 0.951 = 0.020$$

Result: Feature A provides minimal information gain (0.020 bits).
