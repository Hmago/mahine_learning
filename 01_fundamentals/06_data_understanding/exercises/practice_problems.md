## Practice Problems for Data Understanding

### Problem 1: Data Types Identification
Given the following dataset, identify the data types of each column:

| Name      | Age | Salary   | Is_Employed | Joining_Date |
|-----------|-----|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Alice     | 30  | 70000    | True        | 2020-01-15   |
| Bob       | 25  | 50000    | False       | 2019-03-22   |
| Charlie   | 35  | 120000   | True        | 2021-07-30   |
| David     | 40  | 90000    | True        | 2018-11-05   |

### Problem 2: Data Quality Assessment
You are given a dataset with the following issues:
- Missing values in the `Salary` column.
- Outliers in the `Age` column (e.g., a value of 150).
- Inconsistent formatting in the `Joining_Date` column (some dates are in `MM-DD-YYYY` format, while others are in `YYYY-MM-DD`).

List the steps you would take to clean this dataset.

### Problem 3: Feature Engineering
Consider a dataset containing information about houses with the following columns: `Size (sq ft)`, `Number of Bedrooms`, `Number of Bathrooms`, and `Price`. 

1. Propose at least two new features that could be created from the existing columns.
2. Explain how these new features might improve a predictive model for house prices.

### Problem 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
You have been provided with a dataset containing customer information for an online store. 

1. Describe the types of visualizations you would create to understand customer purchasing behavior.
2. What insights are you hoping to gain from these visualizations?

### Problem 5: Handling Missing Data
You have a dataset with the following columns: `Product_ID`, `Product_Name`, `Price`, and `Stock_Availability`. 

1. If the `Price` column has missing values, what strategies could you use to handle these missing values?
2. Discuss the potential impact of each strategy on your analysis.

### Problem 6: Data Visualization
Using a dataset of your choice, create a simple bar chart to visualize the distribution of a categorical variable. 

1. Describe the steps you took to create this visualization.
2. What conclusions can you draw from the chart?

### Problem 7: Data Quality Metrics
Define at least three metrics you would use to assess the quality of a dataset. Explain why each metric is important.

### Conclusion
These practice problems are designed to help you apply your understanding of data types, data quality, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis. Make sure to document your thought process and solutions as you work through each problem.
