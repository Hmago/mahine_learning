## Mathematical Learning Milestones

### Week 1 Milestones:

**Linear Algebra Mastery:**
- Master vector operations: $\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b}$, $||\vec{a}||$

**Calculus & Optimization Skills:**
- Calculate gradients: $\nabla f = [\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1}, ..., \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_n}]$
- Implement gradient descent: $x^{(t+1)} = x^{(t)} - \alpha\nabla f(x^{(t)})$
- Find critical points: $\nabla f(x) = 0$
- Understand chain rule applications in backpropagation

### Week 2 Milestones:

**Probability & Statistics Proficiency:**
- Apply Bayes' theorem: $P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$
