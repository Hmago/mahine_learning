## Mathematical Foundation Overview

This module covers essential mathematical concepts with practical applications:

### Core Mathematical Areas:

**1. Linear Algebra:**
- Vector operations: $\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i b_i$
- Matrix multiplication: $(AB)_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} A_{ik} B_{kj}$
- Eigenvalue decomposition: $A\vec{v} = \lambda\vec{v}$

**2. Calculus & Optimization:**
- Gradient: $\nabla f(x) = \left[\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2}, ..., \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_n}\right]$
- Gradient descent: $x_{new} = x_{old} - \alpha \nabla f(x_{old})$

**3. Probability & Statistics:**
- Bayes' theorem: $P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$
- Central limit theorem and statistical inference

**4. Machine Learning Fundamentals:**
- Bias-variance decomposition: $E[(y - \hat{f}(x))^2] = \text{Bias}^2 + \text{Variance} + \text{Noise}$
- Cross-validation: $CV = \frac{1}{k}\sum_{i=1}^{k} L(y_i, \hat{f}^{(-i)}(x_i))$

**5. Data Processing:**
- Standardization: $z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}$
- Feature engineering and selection techniques

Each topic includes solved examples, practical applications, and step-by-step mathematical derivations to ensure complete understanding of the underlying principles.
