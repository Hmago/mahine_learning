# Linear Algebra Cheat Sheet

## Vectors
- **Definition**: A vector is an ordered list of numbers, which can represent points in space or directions.
- **Operations**:
  - **Addition**: Adding corresponding components.
  - **Scalar Multiplication**: Multiplying each component by a scalar.
  - **Dot Product**: A measure of similarity between two vectors, calculated as the sum of the products of their corresponding components.
  - **Cross Product**: A vector perpendicular to two given vectors in three-dimensional space.

## Matrices
- **Definition**: A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns.
- **Operations**:
  - **Addition**: Adding corresponding elements of two matrices.
  - **Multiplication**: Combining rows of the first matrix with columns of the second.
  - **Transpose**: Flipping a matrix over its diagonal, switching the row and column indices.
  - **Inverse**: A matrix that, when multiplied with the original matrix, yields the identity matrix.

## Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
- **Eigenvalues**: Scalars that indicate how much a corresponding eigenvector is stretched or compressed during a linear transformation.
- **Eigenvectors**: Non-zero vectors that change at most by a scalar factor when a linear transformation is applied.

## Vector Spaces
- **Definition**: A vector space is a collection of vectors that can be added together and multiplied by scalars.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Basis**: A set of linearly independent vectors that span the vector space.
  - **Dimension**: The number of vectors in a basis for the space.

## Applications in Machine Learning
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) use eigenvalues and eigenvectors to reduce the number of features while preserving variance.
- **Data Representation**: Vectors and matrices are used to represent data points and transformations in algorithms.

## Why Does This Matter?
Understanding linear algebra is crucial for grasping how machine learning algorithms work, especially in areas like data representation, transformations, and optimization.

## Practical Exercises
- Practice vector addition and scalar multiplication.
- Compute the dot product and cross product of given vectors.
