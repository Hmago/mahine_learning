# Statistics Cheat Sheet

## Key Concepts in Statistics

### 1. **Descriptive Statistics**
   - **Mean**: The average of a set of values.
   - **Median**: The middle value when data is sorted.
   - **Mode**: The most frequently occurring value in a dataset.
   - **Standard Deviation**: Measures the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values.

### 2. **Probability Basics**
   - **Probability**: A measure of the likelihood that an event will occur, ranging from 0 (impossible) to 1 (certain).
   - **Conditional Probability**: The probability of an event given that another event has occurred.
   - **Bayes' Theorem**: A way to calculate conditional probabilities.

### 3. **Common Distributions**
   - **Normal Distribution**: A bell-shaped distribution characterized by its mean and standard deviation.
   - **Binomial Distribution**: Represents the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials.
   - **Poisson Distribution**: Represents the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space.

### 4. **Statistical Inference**
   - **Hypothesis Testing**: A method for testing a claim or hypothesis about a parameter in a population.
     - **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: The hypothesis that there is no effect or no difference.
     - **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: The hypothesis that there is an effect or a difference.
   - **Confidence Intervals**: A range of values that is likely to contain the population parameter with a certain level of confidence (e.g., 95%).

### 5. **Correlation and Regression**
   - **Correlation**: A measure of the relationship between two variables, ranging from -1 to 1.
   - **Linear Regression**: A method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

### 6. **Bayesian Statistics**
   - **Bayesian Inference**: A method of statistical inference in which Bayes' theorem is used to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.

## Why Does This Matter?
Understanding these statistical concepts is crucial for making informed decisions based on data. In machine learning, statistics provides the foundation for analyzing data, making predictions, and validating models.

## Practical Exercises
- Calculate the mean, median, and mode of a given dataset.
- Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of a dataset.
- Perform a hypothesis test to determine if there is a significant difference between two groups.
- Use linear regression to predict outcomes based on input features.
