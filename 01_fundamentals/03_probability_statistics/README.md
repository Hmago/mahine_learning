## Probability & Statistics in Machine Learning

### Why Does This Matter?
Probability and statistics form the backbone of machine learning. They help us understand data, make predictions, and quantify uncertainty. By mastering these concepts, you will be better equipped to build models that can generalize well to unseen data and make informed decisions based on data analysis.

### Overview
This section covers the essential concepts of probability and statistics that are crucial for understanding machine learning algorithms. You will learn about the fundamental principles of probability, various probability distributions, and the basics of statistical inference. Additionally, we will explore Bayesian concepts, which are increasingly important in modern machine learning.

### Topics Covered
1. **Probability Basics**: Understand the foundational concepts of probability, including events, sample spaces, and conditional probability.
2. **Distributions**: Learn about common probability distributions such as normal, binomial, and Poisson distributions, and their applications in machine learning.
3. **Statistical Inference**: Explore hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and the significance of statistical results.
4. **Bayesian Concepts**: Gain insights into Bayesian statistics and how it differs from traditional frequentist approaches.
