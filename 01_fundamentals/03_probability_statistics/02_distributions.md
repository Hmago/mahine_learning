# Probability Distributions

## What is a Probability Distribution?

A probability distribution is a mathematical function that describes the likelihood of obtaining the possible values that a random variable can take. It provides a way to model uncertainty and variability in data.

### Why Does This Matter?

Understanding probability distributions is crucial in machine learning because they help us make predictions and infer properties about the data. Different distributions can model different types of data and phenomena, which is essential for selecting the right algorithms and techniques.

## Types of Probability Distributions

There are two main categories of probability distributions: **discrete** and **continuous**.

### 1. Discrete Probability Distributions

Discrete distributions are used for random variables that can take on a countable number of values. Some common discrete distributions include:

- **Binomial Distribution**: Models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials (e.g., flipping a coin).
- **Poisson Distribution**: Models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space (e.g., the number of emails received in an hour).
- **Geometric Distribution**: Models the number of trials until the first success (e.g., the number of coin flips until the first heads).

#### Example: Binomial Distribution

Imagine you flip a coin 10 times. The binomial distribution can help you calculate the probability of getting exactly 6 heads.

### 2. Continuous Probability Distributions

Continuous distributions are used for random variables that can take on an infinite number of values within a given range. Some common continuous distributions include:

- **Normal Distribution**: Also known as the Gaussian distribution, it is characterized by its bell-shaped curve and is defined by its mean and standard deviation (e.g., heights of people).
- **Exponential Distribution**: Models the time between events in a Poisson process (e.g., the time until the next customer arrives at a store).
- **Uniform Distribution**: All outcomes are equally likely within a certain range (e.g., rolling a fair die).

#### Example: Normal Distribution

The heights of adult men in a city might follow a normal distribution with a mean of 70 inches and a standard deviation of 3 inches. This means most men will be around 70 inches tall, with fewer men being much shorter or taller.

## Visualizing Probability Distributions

Visualizing distributions can help us understand the data better. Here are some common ways to visualize them:

- **Histograms**: Useful for displaying the frequency of discrete data.
- **Probability Density Functions (PDFs)**: Used for continuous distributions to show the likelihood of different outcomes.
- **Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDFs)**: Show the probability that a random variable is less than or equal to a certain value.

### Practical Exercise

1. **Explore Distributions**: Use Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize different probability distributions. Create histograms for discrete distributions and PDFs for continuous distributions.
2. **Real-World Data**: Find a dataset (e.g., heights, test scores) and analyze which probability distribution best fits the data.

## Conclusion

Understanding probability distributions is fundamental in machine learning. They allow us to model uncertainty, make predictions, and choose appropriate algorithms based on the nature of the data. By mastering distributions, you will be better equipped to tackle real-world problems in data science and machine learning.

### Key Formulas

**Discrete Distributions:**

**Binomial Distribution:**
$$P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}$$
- Mean: $\mu = np$
- Variance: $\sigma^2 = np(1-p)$

**Poisson Distribution:**
$$P(X = k) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}$$
- Mean: $\mu = \lambda$
- Variance: $\sigma^2 = \lambda$

**Continuous Distributions:**

**Normal Distribution:**
$$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$$
- Mean: $\mu$
- Variance: $\sigma^2$

**Exponential Distribution:**
$$f(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}, \quad x \geq 0$$
- Mean: $\mu = \frac{1}{\lambda}$
- Variance: $\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{\lambda^2}$

**Uniform Distribution:**
$$f(x) = \frac{1}{b-a}, \quad a \leq x \leq b$$
- Mean: $\mu = \frac{a+b}{2}$
- Variance: $\sigma^2 = \frac{(b-a)^2}{12}$

### Solved Examples

#### Example 1: Binomial Distribution Problem

Given: A machine learning model has 80% accuracy. It makes 10 predictions.

Find: Probability of exactly 8 correct predictions

Solution:
Step 1: Identify parameters
- $n = 10$ (number of trials)
- $k = 8$ (number of successes)
- $p = 0.8$ (probability of success)

Step 2: Apply binomial formula
$$P(X = 8) = \binom{10}{8} (0.8)^8 (0.2)^2$$

Step 3: Calculate combination
$$\binom{10}{8} = \frac{10!}{8! \cdot 2!} = \frac{10 \times 9}{2 \times 1} = 45$$

Step 4: Calculate probability
$$P(X = 8) = 45 \times (0.8)^8 \times (0.2)^2$$
$$P(X = 8) = 45 \times 0.1678 \times 0.04 = 0.302$$

Result: There's a 30.2% chance of exactly 8 correct predictions.

#### Example 2: Normal Distribution and Z-scores

Given: Test scores follow normal distribution with $\mu = 75$, $\sigma = 10$

Find: Probability that a student scores above 85

Solution:
Step 1: Standardize using Z-score
$$Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{85 - 75}{10} = 1$$

Step 2: Use standard normal table
$$P(X > 85) = P(Z > 1) = 1 - P(Z \leq 1) = 1 - 0.8413 = 0.1587$$

Result: 15.87% of students score above 85.

**Alternative calculation using normal CDF:**
$$P(X > 85) = 1 - \Phi\left(\frac{85-75}{10}\right) = 1 - \Phi(1) = 1 - 0.8413 = 0.1587$$

#### Example 3: Exponential Distribution (Customer Service)

Given: Customer service calls arrive following exponential distribution with average rate $\lambda = 2$ calls per minute

Find: Probability that next call arrives within 30 seconds (0.5 minutes)

Solution:
Step 1: Identify parameters
- $\lambda = 2$ calls/minute
- $x = 0.5$ minutes

Step 2: Apply exponential CDF
$$P(X \leq 0.5) = 1 - e^{-\lambda x} = 1 - e^{-2 \times 0.5} = 1 - e^{-1}$$

Step 3: Calculate numerical value
$$P(X \leq 0.5) = 1 - e^{-1} = 1 - 0.368 = 0.632$$

Result: There's a 63.2% chance the next call arrives within 30 seconds.

**Expected waiting time:**
$$E[X] = \frac{1}{\lambda} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ seconds}$$
