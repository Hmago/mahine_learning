## Practice Problems for Probability and Statistics

### Problem 1: Basic Probability
You have a standard deck of 52 playing cards. What is the probability of drawing an Ace? 

### Problem 2: Conditional Probability
In a class of 30 students, 18 are girls and 12 are boys. If a student is selected at random, what is the probability that the student is a girl given that the student is wearing glasses (assume 10 girls and 5 boys wear glasses)?

### Problem 3: Bayes' Theorem
A medical test for a disease is 90% accurate, meaning it correctly identifies 90% of those who have the disease and 90% of those who do not. If 1% of the population has the disease, what is the probability that a person who tests positive actually has the disease?

### Problem 4: Normal Distribution
Assume the heights of adult men in a certain country are normally distributed with a mean of 175 cm and a standard deviation of 10 cm. What percentage of men are taller than 190 cm?

### Problem 5: Hypothesis Testing
You want to test if a new teaching method is more effective than the traditional method. You collect test scores from two groups of students. The traditional method group has a mean score of 75 with a standard deviation of 10, and the new method group has a mean score of 80 with a standard deviation of 12. Conduct a hypothesis test at the 0.05 significance level.

### Problem 6: Confidence Intervals
A sample of 50 students has an average score of 78 with a standard deviation of 8. Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the average score of all students.

### Problem 7: Chi-Squared Test
You have data on the preferences of 100 people for three different types of ice cream: Vanilla, Chocolate, and Strawberry. The observed frequencies are: Vanilla - 40, Chocolate - 35, Strawberry - 25. Test if the preference is uniform across the three flavors using a chi-squared test at the 0.05 significance level.

### Problem 8: Poisson Distribution
A call center receives an average of 5 calls per hour. What is the probability that they receive exactly 3 calls in the next hour?

### Problem 9: A/B Testing
You run an A/B test on a website to see if a new design increases user engagement. Group A (old design) has an average engagement score of 50 with a standard deviation of 5, while Group B (new design) has an average score of 55 with a standard deviation of 6. How would you determine if the new design is statistically better?

### Problem 10: Monte Carlo Simulation
Simulate the process of rolling two dice 10,000 times. Calculate the probability of rolling a sum of 7. 

### Conclusion
These practice problems are designed to reinforce your understanding of probability and statistics concepts. Try to solve them without looking at the solutions first, and then review your answers to identify areas for improvement.
