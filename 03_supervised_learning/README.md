# 03 - Supervised Learning 🎯

Welcome to the world of supervised learning! This is where machine learning gets practical and exciting. Think of supervised learning as teaching a computer to make predictions by showing it lots of examples - like teaching a child to recognize animals by showing them thousands of labeled pictures.
