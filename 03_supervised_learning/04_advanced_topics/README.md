- Cost-sensitive learning approaches

### 2. **Dealing with Missing Data** 🕳️
- Understanding why data goes missing
- Imputation strategies that actually work
- When to drop vs when to fill

### 3. **Feature Engineering Mastery** 🔧

### Quick Diagnostic Quiz 🤔

Before starting, test your readiness:

1. **Scenario**: You have a fraud detection dataset with 0.1% fraud cases. Your model achieves 99.9% accuracy by predicting "no fraud" for everything. Is this good?
   
2. **Challenge**: 30% of your data has missing values in a key feature. What do you do?

3. **Question**: Your model works great in development but fails in production. What are the top 3 possible causes?
