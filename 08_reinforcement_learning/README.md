# 08 Reinforcement Learning üéÆ

Welcome to the exciting world of Reinforcement Learning (RL) - where machines learn to make decisions through trial and error, just like humans do!

## üéØ Module Overview

Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning where an **agent** learns to make decisions by interacting with an **environment**. Think of it like teaching a robot to play a video game - it tries different actions, gets rewards or penalties, and gradually learns which actions lead to the best outcomes.

### ü§î Why Does Reinforcement Learning Matter?

RL is everywhere around us:
- **Game AI**: AlphaGo beating world champions
- **Autonomous Vehicles**: Learning to navigate traffic
- **Trading Systems**: Making investment decisions
- **Robotics**: Teaching robots to walk, grab objects
- **Recommendation Systems**: Learning what content you like
- **Resource Management**: Optimizing energy usage, server allocation
