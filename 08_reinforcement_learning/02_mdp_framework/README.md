# Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) üé≤

## What is a Markov Decision Process?

Think of an MDP as the **mathematical foundation** that makes reinforcement learning possible. It's like having a formal language to describe any situation where:
- You need to make decisions over time
- Your current situation affects what you can do next
- You want to maximize some long-term goal

### The Simple Explanation

A **Markov Decision Process** is a mathematical framework for modeling decision-making problems where:
1. **Outcomes are partly random** (you can't control everything)
2. **Outcomes are partly under your control** (your actions matter)
3. **The current situation contains all the information** you need to make good decisions

### The GPS Navigation Analogy üó∫Ô∏è

Imagine using GPS navigation:
- **Current location** = State
- **Possible routes** = Actions
- **Traffic conditions, road closures** = Environment randomness
- **Getting to destination faster** = Reward
- **Markov property**: Your next best move only depends on where you are now, not how you got there

## The Markov Property: The "Memoryless" Assumption

### What Does "Markov" Mean?

The **Markov Property** states that:
> **The future depends only on the present, not on the past**

In mathematical terms: `P(future | present, past) = P(future | present)`

### Everyday Examples

#### ‚úÖ Markov Examples:
1. **Weather Tomorrow**: Only depends on today's weather, not last week's
2. **Your Current Location**: Where you go next only depends on where you are now
3. **Chess Position**: The best move only depends on current board state

#### ‚ùå Non-Markov Examples:
1. **Stock Prices**: Tomorrow's price might depend on trends from past weeks
2. **Your Mood**: Today's mood might depend on events from several days ago
3. **Medical Diagnosis**: Might need complete medical history

### Why the Markov Property Matters

**The Good News**: If we can make problems Markov, we can solve them efficiently!
**The Challenge**: Real world often isn't perfectly Markov
**The Solution**: We can often make problems "approximately Markov" by including enough information in the state

## Formal Definition of an MDP

An MDP is defined by five components:

### 1. State Space (S) üìç
**What it is**: All possible situations the agent can be in

**Examples**:
- **Chess**: All possible board configurations (~10^43 states)
- **Pac-Man**: Maze layout, character positions, pellet locations
- **Stock Trading**: Current prices, volume, technical indicators
- **Robot Navigation**: Position, orientation, sensor readings

**Mathematical Notation**: S = {s‚ÇÅ, s‚ÇÇ, s‚ÇÉ, ...}

### 2. Action Space (A) ‚ö°
**What it is**: All possible actions the agent can take

**Types**:
- **Discrete**: Finite number of choices (move up/down/left/right)
- **Continuous**: Infinite possibilities (steering angle, throttle pressure)

**Examples**:
- **Video Game**: {Up, Down, Left, Right, Jump, Fire}
- **Trading**: {Buy, Sell, Hold}
- **Robot Arm**: {Joint angles from 0¬∞ to 360¬∞}

**Mathematical Notation**: A = {a‚ÇÅ, a‚ÇÇ, a‚ÇÉ, ...} or A(s) for state-dependent actions

### 3. Transition Probabilities (P) üé≤
**What it is**: The probability of ending up in a new state after taking an action

**Formula**: P(s' | s, a) = Probability of reaching state s' from state s by taking action a

**Real-World Example - Umbrella Decision**:
- State: {Sunny, Rainy}
- Action: {Take Umbrella, No Umbrella}
- P(Sunny tomorrow | Sunny today, Take Umbrella) = 0.8
- P(Rainy tomorrow | Sunny today, Take Umbrella) = 0.2

**Why It's Random**: The world is uncertain! Your actions influence outcomes but don't guarantee them.

### 4. Reward Function (R) üèÜ
**What it is**: The immediate feedback you get for taking an action in a state

**Formula**: R(s, a, s') = Immediate reward for transitioning from s to s' via action a

**Design Principles**:
- **Positive rewards**: For good outcomes
- **Negative rewards (penalties)**: For bad outcomes
- **Zero rewards**: For neutral outcomes
- **Sparse vs Dense**: Rewards only at end vs rewards at each step

**Examples**:
- **Game**: +100 for winning, -100 for losing, -1 per move (encourages efficiency)
- **Robot Navigation**: +1000 for reaching goal, -10 for hitting wall, -1 per step
- **Trading**: Profit/loss from each trade

### 5. Discount Factor (Œ≥) üìâ
**What it is**: How much you value future rewards compared to immediate rewards

**Range**: 0 ‚â§ Œ≥ ‚â§ 1

**Interpretation**:
- **Œ≥ = 0**: Only care about immediate reward (myopic)
- **Œ≥ = 1**: Future rewards are as valuable as immediate rewards
- **Œ≥ = 0.9**: Future reward worth 90% of immediate reward

**Real-World Analogy**: Interest rates in economics
- High interest rates (low Œ≥): People prefer money now
- Low interest rates (high Œ≥): People willing to wait for money

## Types of MDPs

### 1. Finite vs Infinite MDPs

#### Finite MDPs
- **State Space**: Finite number of states
- **Action Space**: Finite number of actions
- **Examples**: Board games, simple navigation
- **Advantage**: Can use tabular methods
- **Limitation**: Limited complexity

#### Infinite MDPs
- **State Space**: Continuous or very large discrete
- **Action Space**: Often continuous
- **Examples**: Robot control, autonomous driving
- **Advantage**: Can model complex real-world problems
- **Challenge**: Need function approximation

### 2. Episodic vs Continuing MDPs

#### Episodic MDPs
- **What it is**: Clear beginning and end
- **Examples**: Games (start to win/lose), robot reaching goal
- **Advantage**: Natural learning episodes
- **Math**: Total return = R‚ÇÅ + Œ≥R‚ÇÇ + Œ≥¬≤R‚ÇÉ + ... + Œ≥·µÄR‚Çú

#### Continuing MDPs
- **What it is**: No natural ending point
- **Examples**: Stock trading, web server optimization
- **Challenge**: How to handle infinite horizons?
- **Solutions**: Discounting, average reward criteria

### 3. Deterministic vs Stochastic MDPs

#### Deterministic MDPs
- **What it is**: Actions always lead to predictable outcomes
- **P(s'|s,a)**: Either 0 or 1
- **Examples**: Chess (pure strategy), perfect simulation
- **Advantage**: Simpler to analyze and solve

#### Stochastic MDPs
- **What it is**: Actions have uncertain outcomes
- **P(s'|s,a)**: Can be any probability between 0 and 1
- **Examples**: Real-world robotics, financial markets
- **Advantage**: More realistic modeling

## Key Concepts in MDPs

### 1. Policy (œÄ) üéØ

**What it is**: A strategy that tells the agent what action to take in each state

**Types**:

#### Deterministic Policy
- **Definition**: œÄ(s) = a (always take action a in state s)
- **Example**: "Always move towards the goal"

#### Stochastic Policy
- **Definition**: œÄ(a|s) = probability of taking action a in state s
- **Example**: "Move towards goal 80% of time, explore randomly 20% of time"

**Policy Representation**:
```
State ‚Üí Action (Deterministic)
State ‚Üí Probability Distribution over Actions (Stochastic)
```

### 2. Value Functions üíé

#### State Value Function V^œÄ(s)
**What it is**: Expected total reward starting from state s and following policy œÄ

**Formula**: V^œÄ(s) = E[R‚ÇÅ + Œ≥R‚ÇÇ + Œ≥¬≤R‚ÇÉ + ... | S‚ÇÄ = s, œÄ]

**Intuition**: "How good is it to be in this state if I follow my current strategy?"

#### Action Value Function Q^œÄ(s,a)
**What it is**: Expected total reward starting from state s, taking action a, then following policy œÄ

**Formula**: Q^œÄ(s,a) = E[R‚ÇÅ + Œ≥R‚ÇÇ + Œ≥¬≤R‚ÇÉ + ... | S‚ÇÄ = s, A‚ÇÄ = a, œÄ]

**Intuition**: "How good is it to take this action in this state, then follow my strategy?"

### 3. Optimal Policies and Value Functions ‚≠ê

#### Optimal State Value Function V*(s)
**What it is**: The best possible expected return starting from state s

**Formula**: V*(s) = max_œÄ V^œÄ(s)

#### Optimal Action Value Function Q*(s,a)
**What it is**: The best possible expected return starting from state s and taking action a

**Formula**: Q*(s,a) = max_œÄ Q^œÄ(s,a)

#### Optimal Policy œÄ*
**What it is**: The policy that achieves the optimal value function

**Property**: œÄ*(s) = argmax_a Q*(s,a)

## Bellman Equations: The Heart of RL

### The Bellman Equation for V^œÄ

**Intuitive Idea**: The value of a state equals the immediate reward plus the discounted value of the next state.

**Mathematical Form**:
```
V^œÄ(s) = Œ£_a œÄ(a|s) Œ£_s' P(s'|s,a) [R(s,a,s') + Œ≥V^œÄ(s')]
```

**English Translation**: 
"The value of being in state s following policy œÄ equals the expected immediate reward plus the discounted expected value of where you'll end up next."

### The Bellman Equation for Q^œÄ

**Mathematical Form**:
```
Q^œÄ(s,a) = Œ£_s' P(s'|s,a) [R(s,a,s') + Œ≥ Œ£_a' œÄ(a'|s') Q^œÄ(s',a')]
```

### Bellman Optimality Equations

**For V***:
```
V*(s) = max_a Œ£_s' P(s'|s,a) [R(s,a,s') + Œ≥V*(s')]
```

**For Q***:
```
Q*(s,a) = Œ£_s' P(s'|s,a) [R(s,a,s') + Œ≥ max_a' Q*(s',a')]
```

## Simple MDP Example: GridWorld

Let's work through a concrete example to make everything clear!

### Problem Setup
```
+---+---+---+---+
| S |   |   | G |  S = Start, G = Goal, X = Obstacle
+---+---+---+---+
|   |   | X |   |
+---+---+---+---+
```

### MDP Components

**States**: S = {(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,0), (1,1), (1,3)}
Note: (1,2) is obstacle, not a valid state

**Actions**: A = {Up, Down, Left, Right}

**Transition Probabilities**:
- 80% chance of moving in intended direction
- 10% chance of moving perpendicular to intended direction
- 10% chance of staying in place
- If action would lead to wall or obstacle, stay in current state

**Rewards**:
- R = +100 for reaching goal (0,3)
- R = -1 for each step (encourages efficiency)
- R = -10 for hitting obstacle

**Discount Factor**: Œ≥ = 0.9

### Calculating Value Function

Let's calculate V*(0,0) - the value of the starting state:

**Option 1: Go Right**
- 80% chance: End up at (0,1), get -1 reward
- 10% chance: End up at (1,0), get -1 reward  
- 10% chance: Stay at (0,0), get -1 reward

**Expected Value of Going Right**:
Q*(s,Right) = 0.8√ó(-1 + 0.9√óV*(0,1)) + 0.1√ó(-1 + 0.9√óV*(1,0)) + 0.1√ó(-1 + 0.9√óV*(0,0))

This shows how Bellman equations work in practice!

## Solving MDPs

### 1. Value Iteration

**Idea**: Iteratively update value function until convergence

**Algorithm**:
1. Initialize V(s) = 0 for all states
2. Repeat until convergence:
   - For each state s: V(s) ‚Üê max_a Œ£_s' P(s'|s,a)[R(s,a,s') + Œ≥V(s')]
3. Extract policy: œÄ(s) = argmax_a Œ£_s' P(s'|s,a)[R(s,a,s') + Œ≥V(s')]

**Pros**: Simple, guaranteed to converge
**Cons**: Need to know transition probabilities

### 2. Policy Iteration

**Idea**: Alternate between evaluating current policy and improving it

**Algorithm**:
1. Initialize policy œÄ randomly
2. Repeat until policy doesn't change:
   - **Policy Evaluation**: Calculate V^œÄ(s) for all s
   - **Policy Improvement**: œÄ(s) ‚Üê argmax_a Œ£_s' P(s'|s,a)[R(s,a,s') + Œ≥V^œÄ(s')]

**Pros**: Often faster than value iteration
**Cons**: Still need transition probabilities

### 3. Model-Free Methods (Preview)

**When to Use**: When you don't know P(s'|s,a)
**Examples**: Q-learning, SARSA, Policy Gradients
**Idea**: Learn from experience instead of requiring complete model
